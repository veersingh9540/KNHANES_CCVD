# KNHANES_CCVD

The mentioned algorithm uses KNHANES data to perform machine learning-based diagnostic and risk factor analysis for cardiocerebrovascular disease (CCVD).

In order to forecast the presence of CCVD and identify the risk factors related to it, the code trains four different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks) on the chosen features from the KNHANES dataset.


Next, the code assesses the performance of each model on a testing set and outputs the evaluation metrics accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These measures aid in assessing the model's efficacy in accurately identifying patients with CCVD (recall), the accuracy of the model's predictions, and the model's overall performance.

The evaluation metrics for each of the variables are the code's final output.
